>[!note] Direct Proof
>A direct proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a given [[1.2 Implication|hypothesis]] $P$ by assuming its truth and demonstrating that the [[1.2 Implication|conclusion]] $Q$ necessarily follows, such that
>$$P \implies Q.$$

# Examples
>[!example] Prove that for any $a,b,c \in Z$, if $a \mid b$ and $a\mid c$, then $a \mid (b + c)$.
>We can express the n[](1.3%20Implication.md)c=q_2a$ for some quotients $q_1,q_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then, $b+c=a(q_1 + q_2)$, which has a factor of $a$ and therefore can be divided by $a$.
>
>Alternatively, this theorem can be expressed in quantifier form as $(\forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z})(P(a,b) \land P(a,c)) \implies P(a, b+c)$.

>[!example] An integer $0 < n < 1000$ is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
>We can express $n$ as a number $abc$ such that $n=100a+10b+c$. Then, we can express the sum of its digits as a multiple of 9 as $a+b+c=9q$ for some quotient $q \in \mathbb{Z}$. Substituting for $c=9q-a-b$, it follows that $n=99a+9b+9q=9(11a+b+q)$. Since $9$ factors out, $n$ is divisible by $9$.
>
>Since we are solving for $P \iff Q$, we must also prove for the converse, $Q \implies P$. Suppose that $n=9q$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ is (clearly) divisible by $9$. Then, it follows that $100a+10b+c=9q$ is also divisible by $9$. We can massage the equation such that $99a+9b+(a+b+c)=9q$. This leads to
>$$a+b+c=9(q-11a-b),$$
>which is clearly divisible by $9$.
