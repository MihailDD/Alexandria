>[!note] Proof by Cases (Exhaustion)
>A proof by cases is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a given proposition $P$ by dividing the problem into a finite number of exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ and demonstrating that the proposition holds in *at least* one of the cases, such that
>$$(P_1 \lor P_2 \lor \ldots \lor P_k) \implies P.$$
>Each proposition can be proven using any of the proof methods mentioned in this section.

# Examples
>[!example] There exist some irrational numbers $a,b \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$, such that $x^y$ is rational.
>We proceed by cases. Since the theorem
