>[!note] Graph
>A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices (nodes) $V$, and a set of edges $E$, using which the vertices are connected together in some way. Graphs can be
>- *Directed*, used to model one-way relationships between vertices by arrows.
>- *Undirected*, modeling relationships of vertices that go both ways.
>
>Furthermore, we say that an edge $e=\{u, v\}$ is *incident* on vertices $\{u, v\}$, and that the vertices $u$ and $v$ are *adjacent*.
# Properties
##### A connected, undirected graph has a minimum of $v-1$ edges.
##### An undirected graph can have a maximum of $\frac{v(v-1)}{2}$ edges.

# Example
>[!example] Example
>The below graph consists of 12 nodes (vertices) and 17 edges.
