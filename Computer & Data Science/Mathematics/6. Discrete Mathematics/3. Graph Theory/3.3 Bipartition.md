>[!note] Bipartite Graphs
>A bipartite [[3.1 Graph|graph]] is any graph whose vertices can visibly be divided into two distinct, disjoint and independent sets, with edges ==only flowing from one set to the other==. More formally, for any bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ with two distinct sets $L$ and $R$, we have
>$$V=L \cup R$$
>$$E \subseteq L \times R.$$

# Intuition
Although we can't prove bipartition, we can think about as to why the sets $V$ and $E$ can be expressed using the two bipartite sets $L$ and $R$:
- The first fact is simply a union of the two groups of nodes, $L$ and $R$. 
- The second fact states that $E$ is equal to or a subset of all possible combinations of edges between the two groups. **A graph where $E = L \times R$ (every vertex from one group connects to all of the vertices from the other) be expressed as $K_{|L|,|R|}$.**
