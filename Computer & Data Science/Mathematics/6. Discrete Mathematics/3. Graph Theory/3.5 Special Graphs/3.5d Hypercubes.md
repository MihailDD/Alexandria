>[!note] Graph Representation of a Hypercube
>An $n$-dimensional hypercube can be represented as a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\{0, 1\}^n$ vertices, where $V$ is the set of all $n$-bit strings. Two vertices of a hypercube are connected by an edge if and only if the two vertices differ in exactly one bit position.

>Recursively, an $n$-dimensional hypercube is the result of joining two $(n-1)$-dimensional hypercubes with vertices $0x$ and $1x$ where $x \in \{0,1\}^{n-1}$.
# Properties
##### (Hypercube Vertices) For an n-dimensional hypercube, $v=2^n$.
1. *Base Case:* A 0-dimensional hypercube has $2^0=1$ vertex by inspection.
2. *Hypothesis:* Assume that the theorem holds for $n$ dimensions.
3. *Inductive Step:* We see that for $n+1$, $v=2(2^n)$, and therefore the theorem holds for all $n$.
##### (Hypercube Edges) For an n-dimensional hypercube, $e=n2^{n-1}$.
We observe that the degree of each vertex of an $n$-dimensional hypercube is exactly $n$. Simultaneously, we observe that each edge is counted twice. Therefore, $e=\frac{n2^n}{2}=n2^{n-1}$.
