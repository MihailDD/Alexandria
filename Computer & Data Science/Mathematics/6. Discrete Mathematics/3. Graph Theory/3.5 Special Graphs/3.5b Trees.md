>[!note] Tree (Connected and Acyclic Graph)
>A tree is the name for a special [[3.1 Graph|graph]] that is both *connected* and *acyclic* (contains no cycles), such that when one node is disconnected, the graph becomes disconnected. A graph that is *not connected* and *acyclic* is called a forest, and consist of more than one tree. Trees consist of a root, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. The following are all equivalent definitions of a tree $G=(V, E)$:
>1. $G$ is connected and contains no cycles.
>2. $G$ is connected and has exactly $|V|-1$ edges.
>3. $G$ is connected and the removal of any edge disconnects $G$.
>4. $G$ is acyclic and the addition of any edge creates a cycle in $G$.

# Properties
#### $G$ has exactly $|V| - 1$ edges.
*Backward direction. Proceed by contradiction.*
- If $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges, then it is acyclic.
- However, if $G$ had $n-1$ edges and contained a cycle, then removing one of the cycle's edges does not disconnect the graph. Therefore, we can create a tree with $n-2$ edges. However, a graph that contains less than $n-1$ edges is always disconnected (see 3.1).
#### All trees are [[3.3 Bipartition|bipartite]].

#### For all trees, $f=1$.
Since trees are acyclic by definition, it only follows that the plane will not be subdivided into extra faces.
