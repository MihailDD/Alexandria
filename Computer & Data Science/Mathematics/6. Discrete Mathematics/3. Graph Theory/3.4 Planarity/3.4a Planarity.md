>[!note] Planarity
>A planar graph is any [[3.1 Graph|graph]] whose edges do not cross on the plane. For every ==connected== planar graph, the Euler's formula holds, such that
>$$v+f=e+2,$$
>where $v,e,f$ are respectively the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a graph.
# Proof
We can prove Euler's formula by induction on $e$.
- *Base Case:* The formula holds when $e=0 \implies v,f=1$.
- *Hypothesis*: Assume the theorem holds for $e > 0$.
- *Inductive Step*: split in cases.
	- In the case of a connected and acyclic graph (a tree), $f=1$, and therefore Euler's formula becomes $e=v-1$. As per the definition of a tree, this is the minimum amount of edges a connected graph can have.
	- In the case of a connected and cyclic graph (with 1 or more cycles), find a cycle and delete one of the edges. This reduces both $e$ and $f$ by 1, but keeps $v$ constant. Repeat until the graph becomes a tree. Since Euler's formula still holds for trees, by induction **it also holds for all connected planar graphs**.

# Properties
##### For any planar graph, $\sum^{f}_{i=1}s_i=2e$.

##### *(Planarity Test)* For a planar graph, $v-1 \leq e \leq 3v-6$ holds.
The left hand side is already derived from the rule of minimum edges for connected graphs. Therefore, we must only derive the right hand side of the inequality. 

We start by observing that a face of a graph may have 3 edges at minimum: $s_i \geq 3 \space (\forall i)$. We can then express $\sum^{f}_{i=1}s_i=2e$ as $3f \leq 2e$, where $3f$ is the minimum number of total sides for all faces in a graph. Plugging in Euler's formula, this leads us to $e \leq 3v-6$.
##### *(Kuratowski's Theorem)* A graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.
For the case of $K_5$, since $4 \leq e \leq 9$, and a complete graph of 5 vertices contains $\frac{5(5-1)}{2}=10$ edges (see 3.1), the planarity test does not hold.

However, the bipartite $K_{3,3}$ has $3 \times 3 = 9$ edges, and therefore it passes the planarity test. Let's visualize this graph, also known as "Three Wells, Three Houses":
```tikz
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw houses (top row)
    \node (A) at (0, 2) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {A};
    \node (B) at (2, 2) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {B};
    \node (C) at (4, 2) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {C};
    
    % Draw wells (bottom row)
    \node (X) at (0, 0) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {X};
    \node (Y) at (2, 0) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {Y};
    \node (Z) at (4, 0) [draw, circle, inner sep=2] {Z};
    
    % Draw edges (showing crossing lines)
    \draw (A) -- (X);
    \draw (A) -- (Y);
    \draw (A) -- (Z);
    
    \draw (B) -- (X);
    \draw (B) -- (Y);
    \draw (B) -- (Z);
    
    \draw (C) -- (X);
    \draw (C) -- (Y);
    \draw (C) -- (Z);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
As you can see, every node from the one set is connected to the other. This is because there are no triangular (3-edged) cycles in $K_{3,3}$, since that would mean that two nodes of the same set are connected. So, $\sum^{f}_{i=1}s_i=2e$ actually becomes $4f \leq 2e$. Plugging this into Euler's formula, we get $e \leq 2v-4$. Since Euler's formula doesn't hold, the graph is not planar.

##### Every planar graph can be colored with 5 colors.
