>[!note] Proposition
>A proposition is a logical statement which is either true or false. Propositions may be joined together to form propositional forms. We can join two propositions $P$ and $Q$ in the following basic ways:
>1. ***Conjunction:*** $P \land Q$ ("$P$ and $Q$"). True only when both $P$ and $Q$ are true.
>2. ***Disjunction:*** $P \lor Q$ ("$P$ or $Q$"). True when either (or both) $P$ or $Q$ are true.
>3. ***Negation:*** $\neg P$ ("not $P$"). True only when $P$ is false.
# Understanding
There are many more propositional forms, such as XOR ("Exclusive Or," denoted $\oplus$) and NAND ("Not And"). However, any other propositional form may be constructed using one or more of the previously defined fundamental forms. Let's take a step back from defining any more forms and describe a comprehensive truth table for the two more complex forms:

```tikz
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}

% Draw the table borders
\draw (0,0) -- (8,0);
\draw (0,-1) -- (8,-1);
\draw (0,-2) -- (8,-2);
\draw (0,-3) -- (8,-3);
\draw (0,-4) -- (8,-4);
\draw (0,-5) -- (8,-5);

\draw (0,0) -- (0,-5);
\draw (2,0) -- (2,-5);
\draw (3.95,0) -- (3.95,-5);
\draw (4.05,0) -- (4.05,-5);
\draw (6,0) -- (6,-5);
\draw (8,0) -- (8,-5);

% Add the table content
\node at (1, -0.5) {$\textbf{P}$};
\node at (3, -0.5) {$\textbf{Q}$};
\node at (5, -0.5) {$\textbf{P} \land \textbf{Q}$};
\node at (7, -0.5) {$\textbf{P} \lor \textbf{Q}$};

\node at (1, -1.5) {F};
\node at (3, -1.5) {F};
\node at (5, -1.5) {F};
\node at (7, -1.5) {F};

\node at (1, -2.5) {T};
\node at (3, -2.5) {F};
\node at (5, -2.5) {F};
\node at (7, -2.5) {T};

\node at (1, -3.5) {F};
\node at (3, -3.5) {T};
\node at (5, -3.5) {F};
\node at (7, -3.5) {T};

\node at (1, -4.5) {T};
\node at (3, -4.5) {T};
\node at (5, -4.5) {T};
\node at (7, -4.5) {T};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```

The truth table for negation is fairly straightforward, and does not require a graph in this note.

# Properties
##### *(DeMorgan's Laws)* $\neg (P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)$, and $\neg (P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)$.



# Examples
>[!example] Constructing XOR
>XOR is also known as "Exclusive OR" in plain English. It is not true when both $P$ and $Q$ are true. Let's construct it:
