>[!note] Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
>Every integer $n > 1$ can be expressed as a unique product up to reordering of the factors by the form $p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k$, where each $p_i$ is a (not necessarily unique) prime number.

# Proof
There are two steps to proving FTA:
1. Prove that every integer $n > 1$ can be expressed as a product of (not unique) prime numbers.
2. Show that the order of the primes does not matter, if $n=p_1p_2\ldots p_k=q_1q_2\ldots q_l$, such that the $p_i$'s are just a reordering of the $q_l$'s (in other words, $k=l$).

In the first case, we can proceed by
