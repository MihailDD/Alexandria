# Properties
##### $AA^T \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ and $A^TA \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ are *always* symmetric, positive and real for any $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$.
1. We can easily prove that the product is symmetric by taking $(AA^T)^T=(A^T)^TA^T=AA^T$. Same can be said the other way.
2. We can prove that the product is real by

# Example
>[!example] Water Reservoirs
>Imagine a city with 3 water reservoirs, labeled A, B, and C. Each day, $\frac{1}{2}$ of the water in reservoir A is transferred to reservoir B while the remainder stays in A, $\frac{1}{4}$ of the water in B goes to A while the rest is transferred to C, and the water in C is evenly split between the reservoirs. We can illustrate this change of state in the following Markov chain:
>```tikz
>\begin{document}
>	\begin{tikzpicture}[->, auto, semithick, node distance=2cm] 
>		% Nodes 
>		\node (A) at (0,0) [circle, draw] {A}; 
>		\node (B) at (2,2) [circle, draw] {B}; 
>		\node (C) at (4,0) [circle, draw] {C}; 
>		% Edges with labels 
>		\draw (A) to[bend left=20] node[above] {$\frac{1}{2}$} (B); 
>		\draw (B) to[bend left=20] node[right] {$\frac{1}{4}$} (A); 
>		\draw (B) to[bend left=20] node[above] {$\frac{1}{3}$} (C); 
>		\draw (C) to[bend left=20] node[below] {$\frac{3}{4}$} (B); 
>		\draw (C) to[bend left=20] node[below] {$\frac{1}{3}$} (A); 
>		\draw (A) to[loop left] node[left] {$\frac{1}{2}$} (A); 
>		\draw (B) to[loop above] node[above] {$\frac{1}{2}$} (B); 
>		\draw (C) to[loop right] node[right] {$\frac{1}{3}$} (C); 
>	\end{tikzpicture}

>This change of state can be described using the following state-transition matrix,
>$$
>P =
>\begin{bmatrix}
>P_{A \to A} & P_{B \to A} & P_{C \to A} \\
>P_{A \to B} & P_{B \to B} & P_{C \to B} \\
>P_{A \to C} & P_{B \to C} & P_{C \to C}
\end{bmatrix} =
>\begin{bmatrix}
>\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{3} \\
>\frac{1}{2} & 0 & \frac{1}{3} \\
>0 & \frac{3}{4} & \frac{1}{3}

>The column vectors of this matrix describe the outflow of each reservoir **(or the current water in each reservoir)**, while the row vectors describe the inflow of each reservoir **(or the water in each reservoir in the next step)**. Note that each column vector add up to 1, which means that water cannot be lost in the flowing process.
