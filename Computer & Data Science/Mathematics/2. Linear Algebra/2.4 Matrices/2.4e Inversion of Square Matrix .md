# Intuition
The matrix inversion formula just says that given a linear transformation of the n-space $A$, its inverse will reverse that transformation so that there is no net change for any vector in the space by yielding the[[2.4b.2 Identity Matrix| identity matrix]] $I_n$.

# Identities
##### $A$ is invertible $\iff$ $\mathrm{det}(A) \neq 0$
