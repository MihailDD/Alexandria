> [!note] Dyadic Decomposition
> We can represent any [[2.4b.4 Symmetric Matrix|symmetric]] matrix $A$ as a sum of dyadic (outer) product of vectors using
> $$A = \sum^{r}_{i=1}\lambda_i\vec{v}_i\vec{v}_i^T$$
> where $r$ is the rank of $A$, $\vec{u}_i$ is the $i$th [[2.6 Eigenvector|eigenvector]] of $A$, and $\lambda_i$ is its corresponding eigenvalue.

# Intuition
Dyadic decomposition is
