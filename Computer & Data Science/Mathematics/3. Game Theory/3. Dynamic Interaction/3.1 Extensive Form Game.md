>[!note] Extensive Form & the Game Tree
>The **extensive form** representation of a game $G_E$ is used to illustrate sequential decisions by the decision-makers and is specified by the same three infinite sets (players, strategies, payoffs) seen in strategic form games. However:
>- Every **strategy** $s_i$ of a player $i \in N$ in a strategic form game is defined as one complete, [[1. Rational Choice Theory|rational]] plan of action for each contingency that might arise in a game.
>
>Outcomes in extensive form games are represented by a directed [[3.5b Trees|tree]] called the **game trees**. Game  trees contain three types of nodes:
>- A unique **root node** which implies the start of the tree.
>- **Decision** **nodes** that branch from their predecessor.
>	- Every non-terminal node in a game tree is a contingency, with the number of its successor nodes implying the number of possible strategies of the player making the decision in that contingency. 
>- **Terminal nodes** (leaves) which lack successors and imply the end of a single sequence.
>	- Each terminal node represents the payoffs for all players along the **path of play** (sequence) from the root to that specific terminal node.

# Examples
>[!example] Harry Potter
>Consider a game where Harry has £1. He can either give it to Hermione or keep it. If Harry gives the £1 to Hermione, she can either destroy it, or magically double it and give half to Harry. We can represent this using a game matrix:

>In this strange game where Harry can keep the money and therefore Hermione is indifferent between destroying/multiplying it, one of the Nash equilibria $(K, D)$ is clearly not following rational play. This is because **sequence clearly matters**. As such, we need to represent it as an extensive form game with the tree:

>Here, we see that the valid strategies for Harry are $\{G, K\}$, whereas the valid strategies for Hermione given each of Harry's choices are $\{DD, DM, MD, MM\}$. This is because Hermione is faced with the conditional outcome of Harry's decision. As such, every strategy is a complete plan of action that responds to Harry's decision. Take $MD$ for example. This means that if Harry chooses to give the money to Hermione, she will multiply it. However, if he chooses to keep it, she will destroy it.
