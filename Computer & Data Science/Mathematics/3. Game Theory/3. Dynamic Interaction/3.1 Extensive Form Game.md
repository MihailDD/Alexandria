>[!note] Extensive Form & the Game Tree
>The **extensive form** representation of a game $G_E$ is used to illustrate sequential decisions by the decision-makers and is specified by the same three infinite sets (players, strategies, payoffs) seen in strategic form games. Outcomes in extensive form games are represented by **game trees**. Game [[3.5b Trees|trees]] contain three types of nodes:
>- A unique **root node** which implies the start of the tree.
>- **Decision** **nodes** that branch from their predecessor.
>- **Terminal nodes** (leaves) which lack successors and imply the end of a single sequence.
>
>Every non-terminal node in a game tree is a contingency, with the number of its successor nodes implying the number of possible decisions in that contingency. Each terminal node represents the payoffs for all players along the **path of play** (sequence) from the root to that specific terminal node.
