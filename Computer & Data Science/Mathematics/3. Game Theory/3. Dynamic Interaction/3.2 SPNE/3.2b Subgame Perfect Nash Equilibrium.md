>[!note] Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
>A pair of strategies $s_1$ and $s_2$ constitute a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium if for every [[3.2a Subgame|subgame]] $G_E^d$ with root note $d$  in $G_E$, $s_1$ and $s_2$ constitute a [[2.2c Nash Equilibrium|Nash equilibrium]] within $G_E^d$.

>The path of play in a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is known as the **equilibrium path**.
# Intuition
What is the difference between NE and SPNE? Well:
- Nash equilibrium requires rational behavior (best response) only on the path of play.
- SPNE requires rational behavior on AND OFF the path of play.

# Properties
#### *(Existence)* At least one SPNE exists in any finite game.
#### (*Uniqueness)* If no players are indifferent between terminal nodes, there is an unique SPNE.
