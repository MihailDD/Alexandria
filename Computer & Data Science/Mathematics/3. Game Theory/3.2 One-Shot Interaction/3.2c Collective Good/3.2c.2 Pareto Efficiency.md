>[!note] Pareto Efficiency
>An outcome is **Pareto efficient** if it is beneficial to the [[3.2c.1 Collective Action|collective good]] such that no other outcome makes any player better off without also making some player worse off.
>
>Relatedly, an outcome $A$ is a *Pareto improvement* over outcome $B$ if $A$ makes every player better off, and no player worse off.
# Properties
##### The collective good in a strategic form game is a subset of the Pareto efficient outcomes.

##### All finite games have at least one Pareto efficient outcome.

##### A Pareto efficient outcome has no Pareto improvements.

# Example
>[!example] Stag Hunt, Revisited
>The stag hunt game has a clear outcome which is in the collective interest of the players. Consider the following game matrix:
>```tikz
>\begin{document}
>
>\begin{tikzpicture}
>    % Draw the vertical lines
>    \draw (0, 0) -- (0, -3);
>    \draw (1.5, 0) -- (1.5, -3);
>    \draw (3, 0) -- (3, -3);
>
>    % Draw the horizontal lines
>    \draw (0, 0) -- (3, 0);
>    \draw (0, -1.5) -- (3, -1.5);
>    \draw (0, -3) -- (3, -3);
>
>    % Add labels for players
>    \node at (1.5, 1) {Survivor 2};
>    \node[rotate=90] at (-1, -1.5) {Survivor 1};
>
>    % Add labels for Player 2's choices
>    \node at (0.75, 0.25) {S};
>    \node at (2.25, 0.25) {H};
>
>    % Add labels for Player 1's choices
>    \node at (-0.25, -0.75) {S};
>    \node at (-0.25, -2.25) {H};
>
>    % Add payoffs for each cell
>    \node at (0.75, -0.75) {(3, 3)};
>    \node at (2.25, -0.75) {(0, 1)};
>
>    \node at (0.75, -2.25) {(1, 0)};
>    \node at (2.25, -2.25) {(1, 1)};
>\end{tikzpicture}

>Then, the outcome of $(S, S)$ is the only Pareto efficiency in this game. This is because any other choice will negatively influence at least one of the players in terms of utility.
