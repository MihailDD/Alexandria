>[!note] Mixed Strategies
>In a [[3.2a Strategic Form Game|strategic form game]], the mixed strategies $\sigma_i(s_i^k)$ of player $i \in N$ represent the [[4.1 Distribution|probability distribution]] of $i$ playing each of their possible pure strategies $s_i^k \in S_i$, such that
>$$\sum^{|S_i|}_{k=1}\sigma_i(s_i^k)=1.$$

# Properties
##### *(Degenerate Case)* A pure strategy $s_i'$ may be represented as a mixed strategy such that $\sigma_i(s_i')=1$ and $\sigma_i(s_i)=0$ for $s_i \neq s_i'$.
