>[!note] Strategic (Normal) Form Game
>The **strategic form** representation of a game is used to illustrate simultaneous decisions by the decision-makers and is specified by three finite sets: 
>1. A set of **players** $N$ with a single player denoted as $i \in N$.
>2. A set of **strategies** $S_i$ for each player $i \in N$ s. t. the set of all strategies is $S=S_1 \times \ldots \times S_n$, and a strategy profile $s=\{s_i, s_{-i}\}$ denotes all chosen strategies for each player.
>3. A set of **payoff functions** $u_i(s) \in \mathbb{R}$ that denote the payoff received by player $i \in N$ when the strategy $s \in S_i$ is played.
>
>A strategic form game need not have a winner, and [[1. Rational Choice Theory|rational play]] consists of choosing the strategy that maximizes utility for the given player.

# Examples
>[!example] Rock-Paper-Scissors
>We ca[](3.1%20Rational%20Choice%20Theory.md)sic game of rock paper scissors. It consists of:
>- ***Two players:*** $A$ and $B$ independently decide their hand gesture.
>- ***Strategies:*** $S = \{\text{Rock}, \text{Paper}, \text{Scissors}\}$.
>- ***Payoffs:*** Winner wins $1.
>
>We can model these rules into a game matrix, containing all of the game outcomes:
