>In [[2.1 Strategic Form Game|startegic form theory]], a **Nash demand game** is one of infinite strategies where each player $i \in N$ has a demand $d_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for an aggregate quantity of a good $Q$, such that
>$$u_i(d_i, d_{-i}) = \begin{cases}d_i & \text{if } \sum^{|N|}_{i=1}d_i \leq Q \\ 0 & \text{if } \sum^{i=1}_{|N|}d_i > Q\end{cases}.$$
>In a Nash demand game, [[2.2c Nash Equilibrium|Nash equilibrium]] occurs when aggregate demand is met exactly with the aggregate quantity of the good, such that $\sum^{|N|}_{i=1}d_i = Q$.
