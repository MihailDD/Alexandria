>[!note] Mixed Strategy
>In a [[2.1 Strategic Form Game|strategic form game]], the mixed strategy $\sigma_i$ of player $i \in N$ represents the [[4.1 Distribution|probability distribution]] of $i$ playing each of their possible pure strategies $s_i^k \in S_i$, such that
>$$\begin{alignat}{0}\sum^{|S_i|}_{k=1}\sigma_i(s_i^k)=1\end{alignat}$$
>where $\sigma_i(s_i^k) \geq 0$ for all $s_i^k$.

# Properties
##### *(Degenerate Case)* A pure strategy $s_i'$ may be represented as a mixed strategy such that $\sigma_i(s_i')=1$ and $\sigma_i(s_i)=0$ for $s_i \neq s_i'$.
