> [!note] Best Response
> In [[2.1 Strategic Form Game|one-shot interaction]], a strategy $s_i^*$ is the **best response** of player $i \in N$ to a certain strategy combination selected by the other players $s_{-i}$ if for all other strategies $s_i \in S_i$ that player $i$ could use,
> $$u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}) \geq u_i(s_i, s_{-i}).$$
# Example
>[!example] The Contributions Game
>Consider a game of players, who have the choice of either contributing (or not) to a public good. Suppose now that if at least one player contributes, all players get 1 unit of utility. However, contributing has a cost of $0 < c < 1$ utility units. We can model this game into a game matrix:

>Let's first look player 1's best responses:
>- Player 1's best response to player 2 contributing is to not contribute (free-ride), since it is the choice that maximizes player 1's utility given player 2's choice. This leads to the payoff $(1, 1-c)$.
>- Similarly, player 1's best response to player 2 not contributing is to contribute,  leading to the payoff $(1-c, 1)$.
>
>Now, let's look at player 2's best responses:
>- Player 2's best response to player 1 contributing is to not contribute, paying off $(1-c, 1)$.
>- Player 2's best response to player 1 not contributing is to contribute, paying off $(1, 1-c)$.
>
>Since there is no dominant strategy, each player should form expectations of how the other player will play.
