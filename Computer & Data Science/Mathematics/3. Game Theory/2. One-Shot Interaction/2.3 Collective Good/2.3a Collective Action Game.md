>[!note] Collective Action Game
>In [[2.1 Strategic Form Game|strategic form theory]], a **collective action** game is one where certain strategy profiles promote the collective interest of the players using spontaneous or coercive collaboration.
>
>Conversely, a **zero sum** game is one whose strategies do not have a collective action differential, and the sum of the payoffs of each strategy profile amounts to 0.

# Examples
>[!example] Stag Hunt
>The stag hunt game has a clear collective action component. Consider the following game matrix:

>Here, only when both survivors decide to catch a stag do they successfully do so, each receiving  a utility of 3.
>
>The stag hunt game has a clear collective action component in $(S, S)$. The players are much better off choosing to hunt a stag together than going their separate ways or hunting a hare together.

>[!example] Rock, Paper, Scissors
>Rock, paper, scissors is an example of a game that is **zero sum**. Consider the following game matrix:

>There is clearly no collective action component in this game, since when one player wins, the other loses an equivalent amount of utility.
