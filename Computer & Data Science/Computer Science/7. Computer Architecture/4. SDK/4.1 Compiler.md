>[!note] Compiler
>A **compiler** is a specialized software tool in the build process that translates code written in a high-level programming language (such as C, C++, or Java) into assembly language.

# Understanding
The compiler is essentially the first step in the high-level programming build pipeline. Once high-level code is ran, it compiles and gets translated to assembly language (such as MIPS, RISC-V, etc.) tailored to a specific processor architecture. Code such as `for` and `while` loops (that you jump back to), and functions, are translated to labels.
