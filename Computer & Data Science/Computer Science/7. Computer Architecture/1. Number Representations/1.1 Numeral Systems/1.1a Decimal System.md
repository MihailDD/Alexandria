>[!note] Decimal System
>The decimal system is a base-10 numbering system that uses digits from 0 to 9. 
>
>To convert a number $x_{10}$ from decimal to another number system base-$n$:
>1. Find $x_{10} \pmod{n}$ and write it down at the rightmost digit.
>2. Floor divide $x_{10}$ by n such that $\lfloor \frac{x}{n} \rfloor$ and repeat.
>
>Then, to reverse the conversion, 
>$$x_{10} = \sum^{k-1}_{i=0}b_i \cdot n^i,$$
>where $k$ is the length of the string in base-$n$, and $b_i$ is its $i$-th digit.
