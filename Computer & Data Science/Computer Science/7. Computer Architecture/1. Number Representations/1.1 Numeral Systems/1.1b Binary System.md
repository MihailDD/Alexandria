>[!note] Binary System
>A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two symbols: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number is called a **bit**. $N$ bits can represent exactly $2^N$ numbers. Binary numbers are often prefixed with **0b** to distinguish them from numbers in other bases.
>
>To convert a number $x_2$ to base-$2^k$:
>1. Group the bits into clusters of $k$ bits.
>2. Convert each bit to [[1.1a Decimal System|base-10]], and then to base $2^k$.
>
>To reverse the conversion:
>1. Convert each digit of the base-$2^k$ number to decimal.
>2. Convert to binary and cluster each digit into bit clusters of size $k$.
>
>To convert a number from and to base-$n$:
>1. Convert the number to base-10 and follow the steps for conversion.
