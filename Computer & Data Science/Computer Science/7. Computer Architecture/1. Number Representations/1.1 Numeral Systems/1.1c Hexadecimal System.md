>[!note] Hexadecimal Number
>Hexadecimal is a base-$16$ (also base-$2^4$) numeral system that uses 16 distinct symbols to represent values: the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F to represent 10-15 in decimal. Hexadecimal numbers are often prefixed with **0x** to distinguish them. In computer science, they are used as a more compact way to store bits in clusters of 2 bytes (or 8 [[1.1b Binary System|bits]]).
