>[!note] Basic RISC-V Arithmetic Operations
>There are three basic arithmetic operations in 32-bit RISC-V. Pseudoinstructions are italicized:

>|  Operation   |                     Description                      |
| :----------: | :------------: | 
| add |        Sets `x1` to the sum of `x2` and `x3`.        |
| sub |    Sets `x1` to the difference of `x2` and `x3`.     |
| addi | Sets `x1` to the sum of `x2` and some immediate `k`. |
| *neg* | |
>>[!warning] Note!
>>There is no multiplication and division in the vanilla RISC-V instruction set. Refer to 2.1c.2 for ways to multiply and divide numbers.
