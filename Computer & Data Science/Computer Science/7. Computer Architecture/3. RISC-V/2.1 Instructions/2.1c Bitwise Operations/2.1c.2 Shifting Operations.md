>[!note] RISC-V Bitwise Shifting
>The following are the RISC-V shifting operations.

|  sll(i)   |           Shifts the value of `rs1` by `rs2`/`imm` bits to the **left** and stores the result in `rd`.           |
|  srl(i)   |          Shifts the value of `rs1` by `rs2`/`imm` bits to the **right** and stores the result in `rd`.           |
|  sra(i)   | Shifts the value of `rs1` by `rs2`/`imm` bits to the **right**, preserves the MSB and stores the result in `rd`. |
>>[!warning] Important!
>>Shifting **left** **logically** will append zeros to the beginning (least significant bit) of the binary string. Shifting **right logically** will append zeros the the end (most significant bit). Shifting **right** **arithmetically** will append ones to the end (most significant part) of a negative binary string and will append zeros to the most significant bit of a positive binary string.
# Understanding
What is the difference between `srl` and `sra`? 
- The first "logically" shifts the bits, meaning it only shifts them without further action. It is best used for division of unsigned integers. 
- The latter "arithmetically" shifts the bits, thus preserving the most significant bit and therefore the sign of the number. It is best used for signed bits.

You can use the aforementioned operations for division of unsigned and signed integers by a power of two. As for `sll`, you can use it for multiplication by powers of two. Test it yourself!
