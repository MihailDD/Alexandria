>[!note] I-Type Instruction
>The I-type (immediate) [[2.4a Instruction Format|format]] (**opcode** 001 0011) is designed for instructions that involve two registers and one 12-bit immediate, such as [[2.1a Arithmetic Operations|arithmetic,]] [[2.1c.1 Basic Bitwise Operations|bitwise]], [[2.1b Conditional Operations|conditional setting]], and [[2.1d Memory Instructions|load]] instructions. It follows the format:
>
| **31-20** | **19-15** | **14-12** | **11-7** | **6-0** |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: | :-----: |
|  imm[11:0]   |    rs1    |  funct3   |    rd    | opcode  |
>where `imm[11:0]` is the 12-bit immediate and indicates that the 0th bit is stored at pos. 20, `rs1` is the source register, and `rd` is the destination register.
>>[!warning] Note!
>>Because the immediate is 12-bit, it can hold values in the range $[-2048, 2047]$! Any value outside this range will be INVALID!
