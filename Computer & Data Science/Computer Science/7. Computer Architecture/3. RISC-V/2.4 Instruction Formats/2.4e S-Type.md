>[!note] S-Type Instruction
>The S-type (store) [[2.4a Instruction Format|format]] (**opcode** 010 0011) is designed for [[2.1d Memory Instructions|storing]] instructions and involves a lesser, 4-bit immediate. It follows the format:
>
| **31-25** | **24-20** | **19-15** | **14-12** | **11-7** | **6-0** |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: | :-----: |
| imm[11:5] |    rs2    |    rs1    |  funct3   | imm[4:0] | opcode  |
>where the immediate is split up between `imm[11:5]` and `imm[4:0]` to keep `rs1` ad `rs2` at the same place as the R-type and efficiently use the same hardware for obtaining the registers.
