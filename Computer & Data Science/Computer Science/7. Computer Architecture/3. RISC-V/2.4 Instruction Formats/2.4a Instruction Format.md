>[!note] RISC-V Instruction Format
>In the 32-bit RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), instructions are encoded in various formats depending on the operation they perform. Each format has specific fields that provide the necessary information for the instruction. All RISC-V instruction formats include:
>- An **opcode (7 bits):** operation code that specifies which instruction is called.
>- A **funct3 (3 bits):** a 3-bit identifier to differentiate instructions.
>
>Additionally, a format may include the following:
>- A **funct7 (7 bits):** an additional 7-bit identifier to differentiate instructions.
