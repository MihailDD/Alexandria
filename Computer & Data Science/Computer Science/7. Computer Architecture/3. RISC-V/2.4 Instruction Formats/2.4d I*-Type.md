>[!note] I*-Type Instruction
>The I*-type (special immediate) [[2.4a Instruction Format|format]] (**opcode** 001 0011) is a modified [[2.4c I-Type|I-type]] designed for [[2.1c.2 Shifting Operations|shifting]] instructions and involves a lesser, 4-bit immediate. It follows the format:
>
>| **31-25** | **24-20** | **19-15** | **14-12** | **11-7** | **6-0** |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: | :-----: |
|  funct7   | imm[5:0]  |    rs1    |  funct3   |    rd    | opcode  |
>where `imm[5:0]` is the immediate and indicates that the 0th bit is stored at pos. 20, `rs1` is the source register, and `rd` is the destination register.
>>[!warning] Note!
>>The immediate is 5-bit because the maximum number you can shift a 32-bit register is $31$. Any value outside this range will SHIFT YOUR DATA OFF THE NUMBER!
