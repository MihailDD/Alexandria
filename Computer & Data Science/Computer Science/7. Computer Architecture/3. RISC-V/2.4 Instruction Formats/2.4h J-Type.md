>[!note] J-Type Instruction
>The J-type (jump) [[2.4a Instruction Format|format]] is designed for the [[2.1e.2 Unconditional Jump Operations|jal]] operation, since it only requires a destination and a label. It follows the format:
>
| **31**  | **30-20** | **19-15** | **14-12** |  **11-7**  | **6-0** |
| :-----: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------: |
| imm[20]    |    imm[10:1]    |  imm[11]   | imm[19:12] | rd | opcode  |
>where the instruction's label is stored as a 21-bit immediate offset multiple of 4 whose 0th bit is constant and is not stored since it is known. This layout resembles U-type's `imm[19:12]` and I-type's `imm[10:1]`. Finally, `imm[20]` holds the integer's sign and is most efficiently accessed at the beginning of the instruction.
