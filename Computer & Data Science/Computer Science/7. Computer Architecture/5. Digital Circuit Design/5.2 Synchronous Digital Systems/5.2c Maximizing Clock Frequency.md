>[!note] Clock Period Constraint
>The clock frequency inequality ensures reliable operation of sequential digital circuits by requiring that the clock period  $T_{clk}$  be sufficiently long to account for various timing requirements. Formally, this is expressed as 
>$$T_\text{clk} \geq t_\text{clk-to-q} + t_\text{critical} + t_\text{setup},$$
>where  $t_\text{setup}$  is the [[5.2b.1 Setup Time|setup time of the flip-flop]], $t_\text{clk-to-q}$ is the [[5.2a.1 Clock|clock-to-Q delay]], and  $t_\text{critical}$  is the critical path, also known as the path with the longest [[5.1b Combinational Delay|propagation delay]] between the flip-flops in a digital circuit.
>>[!warning] Note!
>>The critical path refers to the path with the longest combinatorial delay *between and excluding two clocked components*.
