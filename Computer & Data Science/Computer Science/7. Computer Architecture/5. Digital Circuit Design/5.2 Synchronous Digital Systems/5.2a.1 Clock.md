>[!note] Clock Signal
>A clock is a signal that provides a timing reference to digital circuits by generating a regular binary square wave. It consists of:
>- The **clock frequency** (Hz), which determines how fast the system can operate, with higher frequencies allowing for faster processing but increasing power consumption and heat. The clokc frequency can be also interpreted as *rising edges per second*.
> 
>- The **clock period** ($T=f^{-1} \space \text{seconds}$), represents the duration of one complete cycle of the clock signal, or simply put between two rising edges.
