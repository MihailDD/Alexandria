# Intuition
We start at timestep $0$ with an input-less LTI $\vec{x}_d[0]=A_dx_0$. Then the state $\vec{x}_d[0]$ is updated for timestep $i=1$ as $\vec{x}_d[1]=A_d\vec{x}_d[0]$. Then it goes through the additive feedback loop and becomes $\vec{x}_d[1]=A_d\vec{x}_d[0]+F\vec{x}_d[0]+\vec{u}_{OL}[0]$. This is simplified as $\vec{x}_d[1]=(A_d+F)\vec{x}_d[0]+\vec{u}_{OL}[0]$. The definition above is similar but also extends for systems that begin with a nonzero input.
