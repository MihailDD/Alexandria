>[!note] Phasor Representation of Sinusoidal Functions

>Similarly, we can represent some time-arbitrary sine function $i(t)=I_0\sin(\omega t + \phi)$ as a sine phasor $\tilde{I}$, such that

>Here, $V_0$ and $I_0$ are the respective amplitudes of $v(t)$ and $i(t)$, $\omega$ is the frequency, and $\phi$ is a phase shift.

# Intuition
Phasors are complex numbers representing the magnitude and phase of oscillating, sinusoidal functions. Geometrically, phasors can be represented in a multitude of ways. Take for example the sine function $v(t)=V_0\sin(\omega t + \phi)$, represented by the phasor $\tilde{V}=-jV_0e^{j\phi}$ (by $\frac{1}{j}=-j$).
