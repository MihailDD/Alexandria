> [!note] Cobb-Douglas Production Function
>The Cobb-Douglas [[6-1 The Production Function|production function]] is defined as:
>$$Y=A_tf(k, n)=A_tK^\alpha N^{1-\alpha}$$
>where $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ measures the capital share of output, while $1-\alpha$ measures the labor share of output. 

Example: A very labor-intensive business will have $\alpha \approx 0$ and $1-\alpha \approx 1$.
