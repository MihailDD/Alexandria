# Intuition
We start by rearranging our national income identity $Y=C+I+G+NX$ into
$$Y-C-G=I+NX$$
where $S=Y-C-G$ is equal to the aggregate supply of savings (since government spending is dependent on taxes). Since we are in a closed economy, we suppose that $NX=0$, which leads us to our model equilibrium,
$$S=I.$$
