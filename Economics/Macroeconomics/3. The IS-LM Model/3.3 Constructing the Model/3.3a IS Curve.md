> [!note] The Investment-Savings Curve
>The IS (investment-savings) curve gives each amount of interest rate that puts the loanable funds market in equilibrium for each possible level of income $Y$, and is given by
>$$Y=IS(CS^+, T^-, G^+, SP^+, r^-).$$
# Intuition
Let's look at the [[3.1a Supply of Aggregate Loanable Funds|supply]] and [[3.1b Demand for Aggregate Loanable Funds|demand]] of the loanable funds market in a static where $Y_1 > Y_2$:
```tikz
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$S$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[] (0.5,1.5) -- (3.5, 4) node[above]{$S(Y_1)$};
    \draw[] (1.5,0.5) -- (4, 2.5) node[above right]{$S(Y_2)$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$I(SP, r)$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[left]{$r^*_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (1.7,0);
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left]{$r^*_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (2.75,0);
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
since savings is negatively dependent on consumption, which is positively dependent on income, a decrease in income will increase savings (and therefore investment). When there is more loanable funds readily available in the economy, banks are more willing to lend money at lower payouts. At the same time, the volume of loanable funds makes it less lucrative to save, and more lucrative to invest in assets. 

We can interpret the above static as one comparing interest $r$ and income $Y$ in the following IS curve:
```tikz
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$IS$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[left]{$r^*_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (1.7,0) node[below]{$Y_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left]{$r^*_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (2.75,0) node[below]{$Y_2$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
Note that changes in the $I$ curve would also lead to a different $IS$ curve.

Additionally, we can express shifts in the IS curve based on exogenous variables. Take an increase in taxation in the loanable funds market ($T_1 < T_2$) for example, and how it transfers to the IS curve:
```tikz
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$S, I$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[] (0.5,1.5) -- (3.5, 4) node[above]{$S(Y_1, T_1)$};
    \draw[] (1.5,0.5) -- (4, 2.5) node[above right]{$S(Y_1, T_2)$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$I(SP, r)$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[left]{$r^*_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (1.7,0) node[below]{$S^*_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left]{$r^*_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (2.75,0) node[below]{$S^*_2$};
    \draw[->, thick] (5.5,2) -- (6,2);
   \end{tikzpicture}
     \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$IS(T_1)$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[left]{$r^*_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (1.7,0) node[below]{$Y_1$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,2.5) -- (3, 0.5) node[below]{$IS(T_2)$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left]{$r^*_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.75,1.5) -- (2.75,0) node[below]{$Y_2$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Note that the new IS curve yields a lower interest rate for the same income. Essentially, when investment goes up, so does saving, and vice versa, which has an impact on income. This is why we model the IS curve as above.
