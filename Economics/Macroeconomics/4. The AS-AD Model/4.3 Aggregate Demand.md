# Intuition
We can also graph the [[3.3c Combining the Curves|IS-LM]] model against different variables. Consider graphing price, $P$, against income, $Y$. Then, shifts in the LM curve driven by changes in price can be expressed as follows, where $P_2 > P_1$:
```tikz
\begin{document}
   \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$IS$};
    \draw[thick]  (1.5, 0.5) -- (4,2.5) node[right]{$LM(P_1)$};
    \draw[]  (0.5, 1.5) -- (3.5,4) node[right]{$LM(P_2)$};
    
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,2.5) -- (1.7,-5) node[below]{$Y_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.8,1.5) -- (2.8,-5) node[below]{$Y_1$};
    
    \draw[->] (0,-5) -- (4.2,-5) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,-5) -- (0,-1) node[above]{$P$};
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,-2) -- (0,-2) node[left]{$P_2$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.8,-3.5) -- (0,-3.5) node[left]{$P_1$};
    \draw[thick]  (1,-1) -- (3.6, -4.5) node[right]{$AD$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
The resulting curve is  the aggregate demand curve, which matches each price level to each output value in the economy by considering price as endogenous. Note that shifts in the aggregate demand curve indicate a shift in either the IS or LM curves due to a change in any of their exogenous variables. Additionally, the aggregate demand curve is independent of the real interest rate $r$.

Let's take a look at how exogenous variables (anything other than changes in price $P$) shift the AD curve. Consider a static where government spending was raised ($G_2 > G_1$). Then,
```tikz
\begin{document}
   \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$r$};
     \draw[]  (0.5, 0.5) -- (4,3.5) node[right]{$LM$};
    \draw[thick]  (0.5,2.5) -- (3, 0.5) node[right]{$IS(G_1)$};
    \draw[]  (1,4) -- (4, 1.5) node[right]{$IS(G_2)$};
    
    \draw[dashed] (1.7,1.5) -- (1.7,-5) node[below]{$Y_1$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.8,2.5) -- (2.8,-5) node[below]{$Y_2$};
    
    \draw[->] (0,-5) -- (4.2,-5) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,-5) -- (0,-1) node[above]{$P$};
    \draw[dashed] (2.8,-3) -- (0,-3) node[left]{$P_1$};
    \draw[thick]  (0.5,-1.5) -- (3, -4.5) node[right]{$AD(G_1)$};
    \draw[]  (1.25,-1) -- (3.75, -4) node[right]{$AD(G_2)$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
This is also the case for any other exogenous variables in the AD framework.
