>[!note] Short-Run Aggregate Supply Function

# Intuition
We can plug the [[4.1c Equilibrium in the Labor Market|equilibrium level of employment]] into the [[6-8 Cobb-Douglas Production Function|Cobb-Douglas production function]] to get,
$$P=P_E\frac{z(1+\mu)}{(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{Y^\alpha}{AK^\alpha}\right)^\frac{1}{(1-\alpha)}.$$
This gives us the short-run aggregate supply. In the P-Y space, we can interpret this graphically as
```tikz
\begin{document}
   \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (4.2,0) node[right]{$Y$};
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4.2) node[above]{$P$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,3.5) -- (4, 0.5) node[right]{$SRAS_{NEW}$};
    \draw[]  (0.5,2.5) -- (3, 0.5) node[below]{$SRAS$};
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```
For the short run aggregate curve to reach its new position, any of the following can occur:
1. Decrease in price expectations $P_E$ lead to an increase in short-run supply since workers can live with a lower wage and firms may seize the opportunity to charge lower prices or produce more output at the same price.
2. Increase in total factor productivity $A$ or capital stock $K$ boosts labor productivity as firms hire more labor, so output rises.
3. Decrease in the reservation wage $z$ leads to workers accepting lower wages and increases short-run aggregate supply.
4. Decrease in the market power factor $\mu$ leads to higher competition, and therefore causes firms to hire more workers and produce more output at the expense of lower prices (since more firms in a market means more competitive prices).
