>[!note] Natural Rate of Unemployment
>The natural rate of employment is the rate of employment when price expectations are equal to actual prices ($P_E=P$), and is given by
>$$N_N=\left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{z(1+\mu)}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}A^\frac{1}{\alpha}K.$$
>Conversely, the natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment when price expectations are equal to actual prices, and is given by
>$$U_N=1-\left[\frac{(1-\alpha)}{z(1+\mu)}\right]^\frac{1}{\alpha}A^\frac{1}{\alpha}(\frac{K}{L}).$$
>Both equations are independent of the price level.
