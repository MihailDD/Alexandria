>[!note] Natural Rate of Output
>The natural rate of output is the rate of output when price expectations are equal to actual prices ($P_E=P$). It means that all available resources in the economy are used efficiently, and is given by
>$$Y_N=A^\frac{1}{\alpha}K\left[\frac{1-\alpha}{z(1+\mu)}\right]^\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}.$$
>Using the natural rate of output, we can calculate the output gap,
>$$Gap=\frac{Y}{Y_N} - 1,$$
>which measures the deviation of actual output from its natural level.
