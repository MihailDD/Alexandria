>[!note] Seignorage
>Seignorage is defined as the printing of money to finance spending, defined as
>$$S=\underset{G_M}{\underbrace{\frac{\Delta M}{M}}}\frac{M}{P}=\frac{\Delta M}{P},$$
>where $\Delta M=\frac{dM}{dt}$ is the amount of change in money supply per unit of time, also the amount that the government spends after printing, and $G_M$ is the nominal growth rate of money.

# Optimal Seignorage
Suppose that the demand for [[3.2c Equilibrium in the Real Money Market|real money balances]] is given by $\frac{M}{P}=L(Y, i)$, where $i$ is the nominal interest rate. Then, in the long-run, output and the real interest rate are at their natural level, and seignorage can be expressed as
$$S=\frac{\Delta M}{M}L(Y_N, r_N + \pi_E).$$
Then, if money growth in a time period increases, so will seignorage:
$$\frac{\Delta M}{P}=G_M \uparrow \implies S \uparrow.$$
However, at the same time, an increase in money growth for a time period will increase inflation:
$$\frac{\Delta M}{P}=G_M \uparrow \implies \pi \uparrow \implies \pi_E \uparrow \implies L(\bar{Y},\bar{r}+\pi_E)=\frac{M}{P} \downarrow \implies S \downarrow.$$
