>[!note] The Great Depression
>The Great Depression of the 1930s is a decade of economic crisis due to a decline in residential investment ($CS \downarrow$) and a simultaneous stock market crash ($SP \downarrow$). In the early years of the great depression, $C$, $Y$, $r$, $P$ and $I$ all fell. The Great Depression was further amplified by: 
>1. A tight fiscal policy that raised taxes ($T \uparrow$) and lowered government spending ($G \downarrow$).
>2. A dramatic increase in [[6.3a Bank Runs|bank failures]] that further reduced investment ($I \downarrow$) and the money supply ($M \downarrow$).
>3. Monetary policy failure due to an insufficient increase in the money supply to raise real money balances.
>4. A [[6.1b Deflationary Spiral|deflationary spiral]] that created a deflation, leading to high real interest rates and a decline in investment ($I \downarrow$).
>5. A [[6.1c Liquidity Trap|liquidity trap]] that almost zeroed interest rates while increasing real money balances.

>The Great Depression may have been ended by one or a combination of:
>1. The election of F. D. Roosevelt, leading to the U.S. leaving the gold standard, giving the FED more control and independence over monetary policy.
>2. The creation of the FDIC in 1933 to insure deposits and prevent bank runs.
>3. The passing of the National Industry Recovery Act (NIRA), which established minimum wages and fair competition.
