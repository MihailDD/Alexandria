>[!note] Information Lag
>Information [[5.3 Lags|lags]] correspond to the time needed for policymakers to become aware of shocks in the economy. Some information lags are very short (like the 9/11 attacks), whereas others (like changes in consumer expectations) may be hard to quantify quickly, since most economic indicators are recorded monthly and may be subject to future revisions even years later.
