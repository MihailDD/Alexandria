>[!note] Destabilizing Policy
>Destabilizing countercyclical policies are policies that negatively influence the economy due to [[5.3a Information Lags|information]], [[5.2b Decision Lags|decision]], and [[5.3c Impact Lags|impact]] lags. The economy may have already recovered from the initial shock, and is shocked again by the policy, which is said to *destablize* the economy.
# Intuition
Suppose there is a negative demand-shock to the economy. However, in due time, the economy adjusts its long-run equilibrium to the shock naturally via a shift in aggregate supply.

Let's explain the steps of deriving this static:
1. Green arrow: A negative demand-side shock hits the economy, shifting the AD curve.
2. Blue arrow: The economy adjusts to the demand-side shock by adjusting the SRAS curve.
3. Red arrow: The countercyclical policy again destabilizes the equilibrium by shifting the aggregate demand curve back to its original position.
4. Orange arrow: The economy re-adjusts its equilibrium.

The countercyclical policy led to a second destabilization and thus to two times the macroeconomic volatility.
