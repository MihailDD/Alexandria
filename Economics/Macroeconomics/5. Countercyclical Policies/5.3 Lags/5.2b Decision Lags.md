>[!note] Decision Lag
>Decision [[5.3 Lags|lags]] refer to the time needed for policymakers to make a decision and actually implement a policy response. These lags may vary from days to months:
>- The FED meets every 6 weeks and may readily decide on a policy, whereas the Federal Open Market Committee can also make emergency decisions if economic conditions indicate a rapid response.
>- Implementing new forms of government spending or changes to the tax code requires the passage of legislation through both chambers of congress prior to the President's approval, and generally takes a long time.
