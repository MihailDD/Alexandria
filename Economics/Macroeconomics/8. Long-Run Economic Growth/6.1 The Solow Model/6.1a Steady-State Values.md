>[!note] Balanced Growth Path
>We can solve for the constant growth rate along a balanced growth path (a trajectory along which all variables grow at constant rates) using the following steps:
>1. Take the [[2.2 Accumulation of Capital|law of motion for capital]], $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+I_t$.
>2. Substitute for savings using $I=S$: $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+S_t$.
>3. Substitute for propensity to save $S=sY$: $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+sY_t$.
>4. Substitute for the [[6-8 Cobb-Douglas Production Function|Cobb-Douglas function]]: $K_{t+1}=(1-\delta)K_t+s(A_tK_t^\alpha N_t^{1-\alpha})$.
>5. Divide by capital stock (or any of the other variables) at time $t$: $\frac{K_{t+1}}{K_t}=(1-\delta)+s(A_tK_t^{\alpha - 1}N_t^{1-\alpha})$.

>Then, using the BGP constancy criterion ($\frac{K_{t+1}}{K_t}=\frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}}$),
>$$A_tK_t^{\alpha - 1}N_t^{1-\alpha} = A_{t-1}K_{t-1}^{\alpha - 1}N_{t-1}^{1-\alpha}$$
# Steady-State Values
No technological growth ($A_t=A$), no population growth ($N_t=N$).
Since TFP and population are constant, they cancel out, leading to
$$K_t^{\alpha-1}=K_{t-1}^{\alpha-1} \iff \frac{K_t}{K_{t-1}}=1 \implies g_K=0.$$This means that for a constant level of technology and population, there is no growth of capital! We can also solve for output per worker:
$$\frac{Y_t}{N}=\frac{AK_t^\alpha N^{1-\alpha}}{N}=AK_t^\alpha N^{-\alpha} \implies g_\frac{Y}{N}=g_A+\alpha g_K-\alpha g_N.$$
Since $A$ and $N$ are constants, $g_A=g_N=0$. Also, by BGP, $g_K=0$. Therefore,
$$g_\frac{Y}{N}=0$$
This makes sense, since no increase in growth of capital stock would suggest a stagnation in investment, and therefore in output (and since population is constant too--in output per worker).

==When the growth rate of all variables is 0, then we say that the economy is in ***steady-state***==. We can then use the BGP constancy criterion to solve for $K_t = K_{SS}$:
$$1=(1-\delta)+s(AK_{SS}^{\alpha-1} N^{1-\alpha}) \iff K_{SS}=\left(\frac{sAN^{1-\alpha}}{\delta}\right)^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}.$$

We can also solve for $\left(\frac{Y}{N}\right)_{SS}$ by plugging in $K_{SS}$:
$$\left(\frac{Y}{N}\right)_{SS}=A^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\left(\frac{s}{\delta}\right)^\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}.$$
Additionally, capital stock and output per capita both converge toward their steady state:
